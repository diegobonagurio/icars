## ðŸš˜ How to run the project?

1 - First you need to clone the repository

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/lucasaugustscode/icars.git
```

2 - You will need to install the project's dependencies with the following command:

```zsh
yarn or npm install
```
**OBS:** You need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.


3 - Now you need to go to the [API](https://github.com/Th3Ang3lo/icars-api) made by my friend from that little star and get the API link and create a **.env** file in the application's root directory. *(.env.example has the name of the environment variable)*

4 - As the project was created with [Expo](https://expo.dev/), just run the command:

```zsh
npx expo start --clear
```

*If you want to run on the CLI, it's also possible thanks to [Expo Bare workflow](https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/managed-vs-bare/).*

ðŸ˜‰ Now just test the application and have fun with the app.
